       Standard Editing
    </h3>
    <p>
        Text editing in SciTE works similarly to most Macintosh or Windows editors with the added
        feature of automatic syntax styling. SciTE can hold multiple files in memory at one time but
        only one file will be visible. Rectangular
        blocks of text can be selected in SciTE by holding down the Alt key on Windows or the Ctrl
        key on GTK while dragging the mouse over the text. The modifier key used on GTK
        can be changed with the rectangular.selection.modifier property.
    </p>
    <p>
       There are two panes in SciTE, the editing pane and the output pane. The output pane is
      located either to the right of the editing pane or below it. Initially it is of zero size, but
      it can be made larger by dragging the divider between it and the editing pane. The Options |
      Vertical Split command can be used to move the output pane beneath the editing pane.
    </p>
    <p>
       SciTE can perform commands to compile or run source files with the output from these
      commands directed into the output pane.
    </p>
    <p>
       For example, if <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> is installed on the machine, open
      a new document, type:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
<kbd>
print("hi")
</kbd>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       as that document's text.
    </p>
    Save the document as printhi.py. <br />
     The document should now appear coloured as SciTE is using the file's extension to decide upon
    the syntax styling to use:
    <blockquote>
        <code>
                <b><font color="#000080">print</font></b><b><font color="#000000">(</font></b><font color="#800080">"hi"</font><b><font color="#000000">)</font></b>
        </code>
    </blockquote>
    Perform the Tools | Go command.<br />
     The output window will be made visible if it is not already visible and will show:<br />
    <blockquote>
        <code>
                <font color="#0000FF">&gt;pythonw -u printhi.py</font><br />
                hi<br />
                <font color="#0000FF">&gt;Exit code: 0</font>
        </code>
    </blockquote>
    The first blue line is from SciTE showing the command it will use to run the program. The black
    line is the output from running the Python program. The last blue line is from SciTE showing
    that the program has finished and displaying its exit code. An exit code of zero indicates a
    successful run. <br />

    <p>
       SciTE partially understands the error messages produced by Python, GCC, Visual C++, Borland
      C++, PHP and other tools which use the same format as one of these. To see this, add a mistake to
      the Python file by adding a second line to make the file:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <code>
        <span style="color:#000080;font-weight:bold;">print</span><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">(</span><span style="color:#800080;">"hi"</span><span style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold;">)</span>
        <br />
        mistake
        </code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       Perform the Tools | Go command. The results should look like:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
<pre>
<span style="color:#0000FF">&gt;pythonw -u printhi.py</span>
hi
Traceback (most recent call last):
  <span style="color:#FF0000">File "printhi.py", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;</span>
    mistake
NameError: name 'mistake' is not defined
<span style="color:#0000FF">&gt;Exit code: 1</span>
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       While it is easy to see where the problem is in this simple case, when a file is larger the
      Tools | Next Message command can be used to view each of the reported errors. Upon performing
      Tools | Next Message, the first error message in the output pane is highlighted with a yellow
      background, and an error indicator is displayed for the appropriate line in the editing pane.
      The caret is moved to this line and the pane is scrolled if needed to show the line. SciTE
      now looks like this:
    </p>
    <img src="PrintHi.png" alt="SciTE after running Python interpreter" />
    <p>
       SciTE understands both the file name and line number parts of error messages in most cases
      so can open another file (such as a header file) if errors were caused by that file. This
      feature may not work where the file name is complicated by containing spaces or ".."
    </p>
    <p>
       If command execution has failed and is taking too long to complete then the Tools | Stop
      Executing command can be used.
    </p>
    <h3 id="CommandSubsystem">
       Command subsystem
    </h3>
    <p>
    Tools can be executed in various modes by SciTE which are called "subsystems". Different
    subsystems are supported on Windows, GTK and macOS. The default subsystem is 0.

    <h3 id="CommandLineArguments">
       Command line arguments
    </h3>
    <p>
       Command line arguments to SciTE include file names, commands and properties.
       Commands and properties are preceded by "-" and are differentiated by the use in
       commands of ':' as the first character that is not '.' or alphabetic.
       Properties use the syntax used in property set files and override any
       properties set in property files. If there is no value given for a property, it is set to 1.
       Double quotes may be placed around arguments that contain spaces but they must be
       placed around the whole argument, not just around a file name, so "-open:x y.txt" works but
       -open:"x y.txt" doesn't.
       On Linux, the standard shell quoting is available.
       The "-p" argument causes SciTE to print the file and then exit.
    </p>
    <p>
        For <span class="windowsonly">Windows</span>:<br />
        The command line arguments "-" and "--" (without the quotes) are special in that they read the
        stdin stream into the last buffer ("-"), or the output pane ("--"))<br />
        The command line argument "-@" (without the quotes) is special in that file names are read from stdin
        and opened.<br />
        <b>Note:</b> when reading stdin into the output pane, when the property split.vertical is 0, the
        output pane is increased to its maximum height.  When the property split.vertical is 1, the output pane is
        increased to approximately half of the screen width.<br />
        <b>Note:</b> If stdin is not redirected, these arguments are effectively ignored.
    </p>
    <div>
       For example,</div>
       <div class="example">
       SciTE "-font.base=font:MS Gothic,size:11" -save.recent ScintillaGTK.cxx
       </div>
       <div>starts SciTE, opens ScintillaGTK.cxx, loads the recent file list, and uses
       11 point MS Gothic as the base font.<br />
       A group of properties can be saved as a property set file (with the extension
       ".properties") and the import command used on the command line:</div>
       <div class="example">
       SciTE "-import c:\os\web_work" SciTEDoc.html
       </div>
       <p>
       A few commands are currently available although this will expand in the future.

       Windows paths normally use "\" to separate directories and these should be doubled in commands.
       "/" may be used instead to separate directories on Windows.<br />
       The following opens /big/icon.txt:<br />
       <div class="example">
       SciTE -open:/big/icon.txt
       </div>
       On Windows, the following opens C:\Program Files\SciTE\SciTEDoc.html
       and goes to the 123rd line:<br />
       <div class="example">
       SciTE "-open:C:\\Program Files\\SciTE\\SciTEDoc.html" -goto:123
       </div>
    <p>
        Command line arguments are evaluated left to right in two phases because
        opening files requires the user interface to be available and there is also a need
        to set some user interface properties before the user interface is displayed.
        The first phase process arguments until just before the first file name would be opened.
        The second phase processes the remaining arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, if you need to perform e.g. a find: or a goto: command on a file, you must put
        the command after the filename, to allow SciTE to open the file before performing the command.
    </p>
        <p>
        For <span class="windowsonly">Windows</span>:<br />
        If any simple file name on the command line matches a directory name, the file open dialog appears - this is dependent upon the property
        "open.dialog.in.file.directory"<br /><br />
        If the property "buffers" is greater than one and the file name matches either a existing file or by means of a wildcard search, one or more files, the
        matching files are loaded up to the property "buffers" count.  Directories are not considered a match in this case<br /><br />
        If the file name is an extension, optionally preceded by a path, and no such simple file name exists, the file open dialog appears, with the given extension as
        the filter.<br /><br />
        If the file name contains no extension, the property "source.default.extensions" is used to provide default extensions to attempt to match the file name to an
        existing file.
        </p>
    <h3 id="Buffers">
       Buffers
    </h3>
    <p>
       SciTE may be configured to use between 1 and 100 buffers each containing a
       file. The default is 1 and this effectively turns off buffers. With more than one buffer,
       the Buffers menu can be used to switch between buffers, either by selecting the
       file name or using the Previous (F6) and Next (Shift+F6) commands.
       A tab is displayed for each buffer in the tab bar although this can be turned off with the
       View | Tab Bar command.
       A tab may be closed by clicking on it with the middle mouse button.
       Setting large numbers of buffers may cause problems as some menus are fixed in length
       and thus files beyond that length may not be accessible.
     </p>
     <p>
       When all the buffers contain files, then opening a new file causes a buffer to be reused
       which may require a file to be saved. In this case an alert is displayed to ensure the user
       wants the file saved.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Sessions">
        Sessions
    </h3>
     <p>
        A session is a list of file names. You can save a complete set of your
        currently opened buffers as a session for fast batch-loading in the
        future.
        Sessions are stored as properties files with the extension ".session".
     </p>
     <p>
        Use File | Load Session and File | Save Session to load/save sessions.
        You can turn on/off "last session autoloading" using SciTE properties
        variable "save.session".
     </p>
     <p>
        If "buffers" variable is set to "0" session management is turned off.
     </p>
     <p>
        Loading previously saved session will close your currently opened
        buffers. However you will not lose your edits, because you will be
        asked to save unsaved buffers first.
     </p>
     <p>
        Opening a specific file from command line overrides "save.session"
        variable state. When you start SciTE loading a specific file from
        command line last session will not restore even if "save.session"
        variable is set to "1". This makes "save.session" safe to use - you
        will never open a couple of files when you are trying to open just
        one, specific file.
     </p>
     <p>
        By setting "session.bookmarks" and "session.folds" variables bookmarks
        and folding states of the currently opened buffers are saved in session
        files and restored when sessions are loaded.

       Running and building commands for some of these languages have been set up but should be
      checked as they will have to be modified to work for many people.
    </p>
    <p>
      To keep menus to a reasonable length some languages are included but have been commented
      out in global options. These should be enabled by removing the comment character '#'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Language settings are determined from the file extension but this can be changed
      by selecting another language from the Language menu. The language menu can be
      changed with the menu.language property.

       Find and Replace
    </h3>
    <p>
       Either dialogs or strips may be used for find and replace, with dialogs being the default.
       Strips are similar to find in web browsers, appearing at the bottom of the
       window and are smaller and less distracting than dialogs.
       They are specified with the find.use.strip and replace.use.strip properties.
    </p>
    <p>
       SciTE has options to allow searching for words, regular expressions,
       matching case, in the reverse direction, wrapping around the end of the
       document.
       C style backslash escapes which are listed in the command line
       arguments section, may be used to search and replace control
       characters.
       Replacements can be made individually, over the current selection or
       over the whole file. When regular expressions are used tagged
       subexpressions can be used in the replacement text.
       Regular expressions will not match across a line end.
    </p>
    <p>
       SciTE supports
       <a href="SciTERegEx.html">basic regular expressions</a>
       with tagging.
    </p>
    <p>
       On Windows, pressing Shift+Enter when the focus is in a text entry field will search
       in the opposite of the current direction, so will normally search backwards.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Keyboard">
       Keyboard commands
    </h3>
    <p>
       Keyboard commands in SciTE mostly follow common Windows and GTK conventions.
       All movement keys (arrows, page up/down, home and end)
       allow to extend or reduce a stream selection when holding the Shift key,
       and a rectangular selection when holding the Shift and Alt keys.
       Some keys may not be available with some national keyboards or because
       they are taken by the system such as by a window manager on GTK.
       The user.shortcuts setting may be used to assign a key to a function.
       Note that Home key behaviour is changed by the vc.home.key option.
       Keyboard equivalents of menu commands are listed in the menus.
       macOS keys differ from the other platforms with the command key &#8984;
       often used where the Ctrl key is used on Windows and GTK.
       Some less common commands with no menu equivalent are:

    <h3 id="Abbreviations">
       Abbreviations
    </h3>
    <p>
       To use an abbreviation, type it and use the Expand Abbreviation
       command or the Ctrl+B key. The abbreviation is replaced by an
       expansion defined in the Abbreviations file. You can open the
       Abbreviations file with a command in the Options menu and
       add abbreviations. There is a default abbreviations file but a different
       abbreviations file can be set for particular file extensions.
    </p>
    <p>
       Each line in the files looks like "abbreviation=expansion".<br />
       The abbreviations names can have any character (except perhaps control chars,
       surely for CR and LF), including high Ascii chars (accented chars).<br />
       Names have properties files limits: they cannot start with sharp (#) or space or tab
       (but can have spaces inside); and they cannot have '=' character inside.<br />
       Abbreviations names are limited to 32 characters. It is probably enough for
       <em>abbreviations</em>...<br />
    </p>
    <p>
       An expansion may contain new line characters indicated by '\n' and
       a caret position indicated by the '|' character. To include a literal '|'
       character, use '||'.<br />
       Some simple examples are included in the distributed Abbreviations file.<br />
       When expanding, the names don't need to be separated from the previous text.
       Ie. if you define 'é' as '&amp;eacute;', you can expand it inside a word.<br />
       When multiple abbreviation names match, the longest matching name will be expanded.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Folding">
       Folding
    </h3>
    <p>
       SciTE supports folding for many languages (see the list of languages
       understood by SciTE for more information.) Fold points are based upon
       indentation for Python and on counting braces for the other languages.
    </p>

    <p>
       The fold point markers (in the fold margin) can be clicked to expand and
       contract folds. Normal clicking does not alter the fold state of child fold
       points; naturally the children are hidden when the parent fold is
       contracted, but when the parent is expanded again, each child is still
       folded or not, as before.
    </p>

    <p>
       Ctrl+Click on a fold point toggles it and performs the same operation on
       all children.
    </p>

    <p>
       Shift+Click on a fold point does not toggle that fold, it expands all the
       child folds.
    </p>

    <p>
       Ctrl+Shift+Click in the fold margin expands or contracts all the top level
       folds.
       "Toggle all folds" in the View menu does the same; it toggles only
       top-level folds.
    </p>

    <p>
       Tip:
       To open a large code block with all its children folded, fold it with
       Ctrl+Click, then open it with a normal click. Then on opening a child fold,
       you will see that the grandchild folds are still closed; if you want those
       'grandchild' folds open, Shift+Click the child fold.
    </p>
    <h3 id="PropertiesFile">
       Properties file
    </h3>
    <p>
       Much of SciTE's behaviour can be changed by editing the properties files.
    </p>
    <p>
       There are four properties files used:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Local properties file called "SciTE.properties" which may be
       present in the same directory as the file being edited.</li>
       <li>Directory properties file called "SciTEDirectory.properties" which may be
       present in the same or in a parent directory as the file being edited.</li>
       <li>User properties file called "SciTEUser.properties" on Windows
       and ".SciTEUser.properties" on GTK.</li>
       <li>Global properties file called "SciTEGlobal.properties".</li>
       </ul>
    <p>
      Settings in the local properties file override those in the directory properties file
      which overrides those in the user properties file which override those
      in the global properties files. Environment variables are also available as properties and these
      are overridden by an explicit setting in one of the properties files.
    </p>
    <p>
      The directory properties file can be used as project options file where user commands and
      compile, build commands should work in the same manner in subdirectories of a project. The
      benefit is that local properties files in subdirectories can be replaced by one properties file
      which is located at the root of the project.
      The evaluation of the directory properties file is disabled by default and must be enabled by
      setting the variable properties.directory.enable to 1 in the user or global properties file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user properties file is intended for customisation by the user,
      leaving the global properties file to contain the default options distributed with SciTE.
      The main use of the local properties files is to change the effects of the
      Compile, Build and Go commands for the files in a directory. For example, I use the javac
      compiler from the Java Development Kit for most work, so SciTEGlobal.properties sets the
      command for compiling .java files to "javac". If I want to use the jvc compiler for the files
      in one directory, then the SciTE.properties file in that directory contains an entry setting
      the command to "jvc".
    </p>
    <p>
      The global properties file should not be edited by the user as it is replaced with
      each release. Instead copy the property into the user properties file
      and change it there.
    </p>
    <p>
     On Windows, the global properties file is located in the directory of the executable.
      The user properties file is looked for in the user profile directory as set in the
      USERPROFILE environment variable, or in the directory of the executable if
      USERPROFILE is not set.
      For GTK the user properties file is found in the user's home directory and the global
      properties in a directory set at build time - normally /usr/share/scite.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two environment variables, "SciTE_HOME" and "SciTE_USERHOME", which the user
      may set to override the standard locations of the global and/or the user properties files
      (this and the following applies to Windows and GTK):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If SciTE_USERHOME is set then it is where the user properties files are found.</li>
        <li>If SciTE_HOME is set then it is where the global properties files are found.</li>
        <li>If <b>only</b> SciTE_HOME is set then it is where both the global and user properties
            files are found.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       There are commands in the Options menu for opening each of the properties files.
    </p>
    <p>
       The files are in approximately the same format as Java properties files which have a simple
      text format. Lines that start with '#' or that are completely blank are comments. Other lines
      are of the form
    </p>
    <p>
       variable=value
    </p>
    <p>
       For long values, a '\' character at the end of the line continues that value on the next line.
       Space characters are significant in values but leading and trailing spaces are not significant in variable names
       so "<span class="example">&nbsp;x&nbsp;=1</span>" defines a variable called "x".
       Values may include the values of other variables by using $(variablename).
      </p>
      <p>
      The "=" function compares strings (separated by ";") and if they are the same yields "1" else "0".
      To test if the value of "Status" is "2":
      <span class="example">$(= $(Status);2)</span>
      </p>
      <p>
      The "star" function may be used to collect the values of all variables that start with a particular prefix.
      <span class="example">all.languages=$(star&nbsp;language.)</span> finds every variable
      that starts with "language." and assigns that to all.languages.
      This can be used to combine settings from many files for user interface elements such as the Language menu.
      Within a property file level (local, directory, user, global) the ordering is alphabetically by variable name
      which allows a degree of control over the ordering.
      Prefixes that are used by the standard distribution are
      <a href="#property-star-filter">"*filter."</a>, <a href="#property-star-language">"*language."</a>,
      and <a href="#property-star-source.patterns">"*source.patterns."</a> with the
      initial "*" being a convention that the variables are meant for use in a star function.
      These prefixes are discussed in the <a href="#DefinedVariables">"Defined variables"</a> section.
      </p>
      <p>
      Colours are defined like HTML with '#' followed by 6 or 8 hexadecimal digits #RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA
      defining the red, green, blue, and alpha values of the colour.
      Alpha is the degree of translucency with 00 completely transparent and FF completely opaque.
      A 6 digit colour is assumed to be completely opaque.
      Only a few settings can currently be set translucent with an 8-digit value.
      </p>
      <p>
      On Windows, values may be scaled using the current screen dots-per-inch so that they use more
      pixels on high resolution screens and appear a reasonable size.
      <span class="example">margin.width=$(scale&nbsp;16)</span> makes the margin 16 pixels wide
      on a normal screen and 32 pixels wide when the screen is set to 200%.
      </p>
      <p>
      There are
      some variables set by the environment to access the name of the current file as well:

       Some features use file name patterns to see which variable to use. For example, the lexer
      variable can be specialised for a particular file, or a group of files based upon wildcard
      matching so:<br />
       <b>lexer.makefile=makefile</b> indicates that the lexer called "makefile" should be used on
      files called "makefile".<br />
       <b>lexer.*.cxx=cpp</b> indicates that the lexer called "cpp" should be used on files with a
      "cxx" extension.<br />
       Variable substitution is available on the left hand side of file pattern assignments and
      look like this:<br />
       <b>file.patterns.html=*.html;*.htm;*.asp;*.shtml</b><br />
       <b>command.go.$(file.patterns.html)=file://$(FilePath)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    Wildcard matching treats '?' as matching any character and '*' as matching any number of characters, so
    "*.mak" will match "proj.mak";
    "Makefile*" will match "Makefile.in"; and
    "*.x?l" will match "data.xml" and "transform.xsl".
    </p>
    <p>
    Properties files are not treated as having a particular encoding, however individual property values
    may be treated as having an encoding. For file names, commands, and user interface text, this is
    UTF-8 so it may be easier to edit properties files as UTF-8 by inserting a coding cookie as explained later.
    Other properties may be treated as byte sequences (like word.characters.<i>filepattern</i>) or in an implicit
    encoding (such as keywords.<i>filepattern</i> matching the document encoding) so that it may be better to
    edit these settings using a non-UTF-8 encoding. Where both UTF-8 and non-UTF-8 values are wanted,
    two files can be used with different encodings and an import statement to include one in the other.

    <h3 id="ImportAndConditional">
       Importing properties files and conditional logic
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="property-import"></a>
       The 'import' statement includes a properties file as if the text were
       inline at that point. The imported properties file
       is either relative to the base file or absolute and a '.properties'
       extension is assumed. Therefore an "import Lua" statement in
       c:\os\scite\bin\SciTEGlobal.properties will import
       c:\os\scite\bin\Lua.properties.
       Any import statements in imported files are relative to directory of the original file,
       rather than the current file.
    </p>
    <p>
       All of the properties files in a directory can be imported with "import *".
       This does not import generic properties files like user properties or abbreviations.
       The set of files that are imported can be controlled with the imports.include and imports.exclude
       properties.
    </p>
    <p>
       Imported files are not scope walls: properties may be redefined in another file.
       Thus, if a file contains both "import cplusplus", "import java", and "style.cpp.1=fore:$(comment.colour)" then
       cplusplus.properties contains "comment.colour=#800000" and java.properties contains
       "comment.colour=#008000" then the last definition wins and is active for the definitions in the base
       file as well as any definitions in cplusplus.properties and java.properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="property-if"></a>
      The 'if' statement takes one argument which is a
      symbol or expression that may be defined earlier in this property set file or in a base
      property set. If the symbol evaluates to '0' then the test fails.
      An empty string or not present symbol evaluates to 0.
      An expression that evaluates to 0 or empty fails.
      Into the very top property set
      is inserted one of 'PLAT_GTK' with value '1',
      'PLAT_WIN' with value '1', or 'PLAT_MAC' with value '1'.
      For both PLAT_GTK and PLAT_MAC, 'PLAT_UNIX' is inserted with value '1'.
      The system properties Appearance and Contrast are also available for use in expressions.
      If the test succeeds then following indented statements are executed. When a
      non-indented statement is found the if clause is finished. Only simple set
      statements are allowed in if clauses. The evaluation of if statements occurs
      at read time, not at evaluation time.
      A reread is forced if either of the system properties changes.</p>
     <div class="example">
     if PLAT_WIN<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caret.fore=#00FF00<br />
     if $(= $(Appearance);1)<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caret.fore=#FFFFFF<br />
     </div>
    <p>
      Local and directories properties files may test the value of the current file in "if" tests with
      $(FilePath), $(FileDir), $(FileName), $(FileExt), $(FileNameExt), and $(RelativePath).</p>
     <div class="example">
     if $(= $(FileNameExt);HeaderEOLFill_0.md)<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lexer.markdown.header.eolfill=0<br />
     if $(= $(FileExt);pl)<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edge.mode=1<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edge.column=79<br />
     </div>
      <p>The "match" statement is like "if" but implicitly matches patterns against $(RelativePath), allowing wildcards *, ?;
      sets [a-z%]; and alternates {cpp,cxx,ixx}.
      Only Unix-style "/" directory separators may be used as "\" may be used as a quote.
      If there is no "/" in the pattern then "**/" is prepended to allow matching in any subdirectory.
      There should be exactly one space between "match" and the pattern and trailing whitespace is removed.</p>
     <div class="example">
     match *.{js,py}<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;colour.code.comment.line=fore:#70B060<br />
     match lexilla/**/Lex*.[ci]xx<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font.comment=Cascadia Code<br />
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lexer.cpp.escape.sequence=1<br />
     </div>
    <p>
      <a name="property-module"></a>
      The 'module' statement is meant for use in the single-file distribution Sc1 where all of the
      standard .properties files are joined together as a resource in the executable.
      The module statement marks which file each segment originally came from so that the
      imports.include and imports.exclude properties will work with Sc1 and unwanted properties
      will not be active. The syntax is "module &lt;name&gt;" and the effect is to either process or
      ignore all text up to the next module statement depending on whether the name is in
      imports.include or imports.exclude.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Parameters">
       Command parameters and prompting
    </h3>
    <p>
      SciTE has 4 properties $(1) .. $(4) which can be used to run commands with
      changeable parameters. To set the parameter values, use the View | Parameters
      command to view the modeless Parameters dialog which shows the current values
      of these parameters and allows setting new values. The accelerator keys for the main
      window remain active while this dialog is displayed, so it can be used to rapidly run
      a command several times with different parameters. Alternatively, a command can be
      made to display the modal Parameters dialog when executed by starting the
      command with a '*' which is otherwise ignored. If the modeless Parameters dialog is
      already visible, then the '*' is ignored.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Encodings">
       Encodings
    </h3>
    <p>
      SciTE will automatically detect the encoding scheme used for Unicode files that
      start with a Byte Order Mark (BOM).
      The UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings are recognised including both Little Endian and
      Big Endian variants of UTF-16.
    </p>
    <p>
      UTF-8 files will also be recognised when they contain a coding cookie on one of the
      first two lines. A coding cookie looks similar to "coding: utf-8" ("coding" followed by ':'
      or '=', optional whitespace, optional quote, "utf-8") and is normally contained in
      a comment:</p>
      <div class="example"># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-</div>
      For XML there is a declaration:<br />
      <div class="example">&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?&gt;</div>
    <p>
      For other encodings set the code.page and character.set properties.

          An item may define the representation of a character or set an appearance or colour.
          A representation item contains a character followed by '=' and its representation text.
          Hexadecimal Unicode escapes may be used: '\x' followed by 2 hexadecimal digits, '\u' followed by 4, or '\U' followed by 8.
          Appearance items start with '!' followed by an optional appearance number, '0' for plain or '1' for blobs,
          '' for default.
          Colour items start with '#' followed by 6 (opaque), 8 (translucent), or 0 (default) hexadecimal digits.
          By default, representations are shown in the colour of the style of the original text.
          Appearance and colour items continue to affect following representation items until they are changed or reset.
          To specify the characters '\', '=', ',', '!', or '#' use an escape.

          Extra properties defined for the status bar are LineNumber, ColumnNumber, and
          OverType which is either "OVR" or "INS" depending on the overtype status.

        There are two orders in which the text area may be drawn offering a trade-off
        between speed and allowing all pixels of text to be seen even when they overlap
        other elements.
        There may be some flickering on some platforms if buffered drawing is not turned on.<br/>
        Two phase drawing (phases.draw=1)
        draws all the backgrounds of a line first and then draws the text
        in transparent mode. Lines are drawn separately and no line will overlap another
        so any pixels that overlap into another line such as extreme ascenders and
        descenders on characters will be cut off.<br/>
        Multiple phase drawing (phases.draw=2)
        draws the whole area multiple times, once for each feature, building up the
        the appearance in layers or phases. The coloured backgrounds for all lines are
        drawn before any text and then all the text is drawn in transparent mode over this
        combined background without clipping text to the line boundaries. This allows
        extreme ascenders and descenders to overflow into the adjacent lines.
        This mode is incompatible with buffered.draw so will be treated as phases.draw=1
        when buffered.draw=1.<br/>
        The default is for drawing to be two phase.<br />
        Single phase drawing (phases.draw=0) is a deprecated mode that was used in previous
        releases. While it can still be enabled, it is not supported and may cause incorrect drawing.<br/>

          This zone is defined as a number of pixels near the vertical margins,
          and as a number of lines near the horizontal margins.<br />
          By keeping the caret away from the edges, it is seen within its context,
          so it is likely that the identifier that the caret is on can be completely seen,
          and that the current line is seen with some of the lines following it which are
          often dependent on that line.</p>

          <p>If strict is set, the policy is enforced... strictly.<br />
          The caret is centred on the display if slop is not set,
          and cannot go in the UZ if slop is set.</p>

          <p>If jumps is set, the display is moved more energetically
          so the caret can move in the same direction longer before the policy is applied again.<br />
          '3UZ' notation is used to indicate three time the size of the UZ as a distance to the margin.</p>

          <p>If even is not set, instead of having symmetrical UZs,
          the left and bottom UZs are extended up to right and top UZs respectively.<br />

        additional characters may be allowed.
        For example, in Python, '.' is not normally considered part of a word
        when selecting text, but it is good to allow "string.replace" to show a
        calltip so calltip.python.word.characters=._$(chars.alpha) would be a

          This property changes the behaviour of the home and end keys when dynamic
          line wrapping is turned on.  When set to 0 (the default), the Home and End
          keys will move the caret to the very beginning / end of the 'logical'
          line, whether or not the line is wrapped over multiple lines in the display.
          When this property is set to 1, the caret moves to the end of the current
          'display' line if you press End once, or to the very end of the 'logical'
          line if you press End again.  Likewise, the Home key moves first to the
          beginning of the 'display' line, then on to the very beginning of the line.

          By default (0), syntax styling is performed for all the currently visible text before displaying it.

          With idle.styling=1, a small amount of styling is performed before display and then
          further styling is performed incrementally in the background. This may result in the
          text initially appearing uncoloured and then, some time later, it is coloured.
          Text after the currently visible portion may be styled in the background with 2.
          To style both before and after the visible text in the background use the value 3.

        A large proportion of the time spent in the editor is used to lay out text prior
        to drawing it. This information often stays static between repaints so can
        be cached with these settings. There are four levels of caching. 0 is no caching,
        1 caches the line that the caret is on, 2 caches the visible page as well as the caret,
        and 3 caches the whole document. The more that is cached, the greater the
        amount of memory used, with 3 using large amounts of memory, 7 times the
        size of the text in the document. However,
        level 3 dramatically speeds up dynamic wrapping by around 25 times on large
        source files so is a very good option to use when wrapping is turned on and
        memory is plentiful.

          The Find in Files command works in a similar way to the building commands executing a
          command line tool with output redirected to the output pane. If the command produces
          output understood by one of the error output passes, as does grep, then the F4 and
          Shift+F4 keys can be used to move through all the matches. The $(find.what),
          $(find.files), and $(find.directory) variables can be used for the values from the
          Find in Files dialog.<br />
          There are some scripts that implement this feature in Perl better than grep does
          itself
          <a href="http://jenda.krynicky.cz/#SciteFind">here</a> and
          <a href="http://www.forusers.com/forme/finder.zip">here</a>.
          This command line works with Cygwin on Windows, with modifications to suit
          the Cygwin installation directory:<br />
        <div class="example">
find.command=cmd /c c:\cygwin\bin\find "$(find.directory)"
-name "$(find.files)" -print0 |
c:\cygwin\bin\xargs -0 fgrep -G -n "$(find.what)"
          </div>
          On Windows, the find string can be given to the find command through
          its standard input stream to avoid problems with quote interpretation.
          To do this, specify find.input to be the search string, $(find.what).
          <br />
          If find.command is empty then SciTE's own search code is used. This only does a
        simple search without regular expressions and is faster than running an external program.
        <br />
          When defining find.command, to specify the value of the option for the "match case" use
          $(find.matchcase), and to specify the value of the option "whole word" use

        Block comments are comments that start with a particular string and
        continue until the end of line.
        The comment.block property sets the string to be inserted or deleted
        at the start of the selected lines when the Block Comment or Uncomment
        command is performed. To make this command perform sensibly over
        a range of text that already contains comments and other code, the string
        can be defined to contain a character such as '~' that is not used in real
        comments.<br />
        Set comment.block.at.line.start to "1" to place block comment symbols
        at the start of the lines, instead of just before the first non-blank
        character of the lines.<br />
        Stream comments start with a particular string and end with another
        particular string and may continue over line ends. These are defined
        with comment.stream.start and comment.stream.end. <br />
        Box comments are a form of stream comment that takes several lines
        and uses different strings for the start, end and other lines in the range.
        These are defined with comment.box.start,
        comment.box.middle and comment.box.end.

        of preprocessor conditionals are defined by the other three properties.

          A lexer splits a file up into syntactic pieces. SciTE can then display these pieces in
          different visual styles. Many lexers are included in SciTE for popular
          programming languages such as Python, Java, C/C++, JavaScript and VB. Often several file
          extensions (.cpp, .cc, .h) can map to one language (C++) and hence one lexer. These
          settings associate a file name with a lexer.<br />
          The lexers included in SciTE are written in C++ and compiled into the SciTE executable.
          Lexers can also be written as a <a href="ScriptLexer.html">Lua script</a>

          On Unix, command files often have no extension and instead specify the interpreter
                    to use for the file in an initial line that starts with "#!". When the lexer can not be
                         otherwise determined and the file starts with "#!", the initial line is split up into words and
                         each word is prepended with "shbang.". If a property with this name exists then it is
                         treated as the extension of the file. For example, <span class="example">shbang.python=py</span> will be
                         triggered by an initial line <span class="example">#!/usr/bin/env python</span> so the file will be treated as Python.

          Most of the lexers differentiate between names and keywords and use the keywords
          variables to do so. To avoid repeating the keyword list for each file extension, where
          several file extensions are used for one language, a keywordclass variable is defined in
          the distributed properties file although this is just a convention. Some lexers define a
          second set of keywords which will be displayed in a different style to the first set of
          keywords. This is used in the HTML lexer to display JavaScript keywords in a different
          style to HTML tags and attributes.<br />
        Keywords can be prefix based so ^GTK_ will treat all words that start
        with GTK_ as keywords.

          Substyles are mainly used to display sets of identifiers distinctly.
          When working with a particular library, you may want to highlight all the calls to functions in that library
          differently to your own functions or operating system calls.
          Substyles splits one style, commonly an identifier style, into several groups.
          Only some lexers support this and within a lexer it will only be supported for some styles.
          Currently the cpp lexer allows substyles for identifiers (11) and
          comment doc keywords (17), and the python lexer allows substyles for identifiers (11).
          Language properties files will specify the styles that can be split.<br />
          This setting defines how many substyles are allocated to a particular main style.
          To allow 2 extra styles for identifiers in C++:
          <div class="example">
                substyles.cpp.11=2
          </div>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr id='property-substylewords'>
        <td>
          substylewords.<i>mainstyle</i>.<i>substyle</i>.<i>filepattern</i>
        </td>
        <td>
          This property defines which words are to be styled in a particular substyle, in a similar way to keywords.
          For example, to use the first substyle of identifiers (11) for the C++ standard library identifiers "std", "map",
          "string", and "vector":
          <div class="example">
                substylewords.11.1.$(file.patterns.cpp)=std map string vector
          </div>

        <td>
          style.<i>lexer</i>.<i>mainstyle</i>.<i>substyle</i>
        </td>
        <td>
          This property defines the visual appearance of a substyle.
          For example, to display the first substyle of identifiers (11) as pink:
          <div class="example">
                style.cpp.11.1=fore:#EE00AA

        This setting allows choosing different ways of drawing text on Windows and macOS.
        The appearance will depend on platform settings and, on Windows, the technology setting.
        This setting does not currently have any effect on GTK.

          Brace highlighting is a feature that shows the range of a brace when the caret is
          positioned immediately after it. It is especially useful when complex nested braces are
          used. The characters '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', and '}' are considered braces. The feature
          defaults to off (because it slows cursor movement) unless braces.check is set to 1. If
          braces.sloppy is set to 1 then if there is no brace before the caret then the character
          after the caret is checked. The highlighting is performed by displaying the braces in
          style number 34 or in style number 35 if there is no matching brace. While this is a full
          style, to avoid partial display of the braces, it is best to make this style differ from
          the standard style of braces only in foreground and background colour. Only braces with
          style set to braces.<i>lexer</i>.style (which defaults to 0) are candidates for brace
          match highlighting.

          Extra commands can be added to the Tools menu. For example to include the 'astyle'
          indenter, the properties file could contain
         <div class="example">command.name.0.*.cc=Indent<br />
                command.0.*.cc=astyle -taO $(FileNameExt)<br />
                command.is.filter.0.*.cc=1</div>
          The first line defines the string that will appear in the Tools menu (immediately below
          'Go'). The second line is the command string, similar to those of the compile, build, and
          go commands. The optional command.is.filter property states that the command modifies the
          current file so it may need to be read in after performing the command if
          load.on.activate is set.<br />
        If command.save.before is set to 1, SciTE automatically saves the file before execution.
        If it is set to 2, SciTE will not save the file, otherwise SciTE asks you.

        On Windows, the optional command.input property specifies text that will be piped
        to the command.  This may reference other properties; for example,
        <span class="example">command.input.0.*.cc=$(CurrentSelection)</span>
        would pipe the current selection to the command processes.
        The command.input property is only supported for subsystem 0
        (command line programs).<br />
        <br />

        The optional command.replace.selection can be used to specify that the
        command output should replace the current selection (or be inserted at the cursor
        location, if there is no selection).  This property has three available settings:
        0, the default, means do not replace the selection.  1 means replace the selection
        when the command finishes.  2 means replace the selection only if the command
        finishes with an exit code of 0.  If the user cancels the command via "Tools / Stop
        Executing", the selection will not be replaced even in mode 1.  Note, commands run
        asynchronously, so you are not prevented from modifying the document or even
        switching buffers while a command is running.  However, please bear in mind that
        command.replace.selection will send the output to whatever window is active <i>when
        the command completes</i>.<br />

        A final command property is command.quiet.
        A value of 1 indicates that the command I/O should not be echoed to the output pane.
        This may be useful in combination with command.input and command.replace.selection.<br />
        <br />

        The command.mode property is a comma-separated list of flags / settings.  Each mode
        setting can have an argument, separated from the setting name by a colon.  For
        most of these, the argument portion is optional; if the setting name appears without
        an argument, this works the same as "setting:yes".  If a setting is included in
        the command.mode but also appears as a separate command property, the mode property
        will be overridden.  Similarly, if a single setting appears more than once with
        different arguments, the last valid argument takes priority.  The supported
        command.mode settings are:
      <div class="example">
filter - accepts keyword arguments yes and no<br />
quiet - accepts keyword arguments yes and no<br />
replaceselection - accepts yes, no, and auto<br />
savebefore - accepts yes, no, and prompt<br />
subsystem - console, windows, shellexec, lua, director, winhelp, htmlhelp, immediate<br />
groupundo - yes or no
</div>
        Currently, all of these except groupundo are based on individual properties with
        similar names, and so are not described separately here.  The groupundo setting
        works with subsystem 3 (lua / director), and indicates that SciTE should treat any
        changes made by the command as a single undo action.  A command that uses the
        groupundo setting should not change which buffer is active in the editor.<br />

        The command.shortcut property allows you to specify a keyboard shortcut for the
        command.  By default, commands 0 to 9 have keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+0 to Ctrl+9
        respectively, but this can be overridden.  For commands numbered higher than 9,
        there is no default keyboard shortcut.  The notation used to specify keyboard
        shortcuts is the same as for the user.shortcuts property, described elsewhere
        in this document.<br />
        <br />

        If the text of a command starts with '*' then the Parameters dialog is displayed to
        prompt for parameters before executing the command. The initial '*' is not included
        in the command that is executed.<br />
        <br />

        The command number can be in the range of 0 to 49. Command numbers 0 to 9 are
        assigned Ctrl+Number shortcuts. Internally these commands use IDs starting from
        1100 (IDM_TOOLS) which can be used in user.shortcuts and user.context.menu as:
         <div class="example">user.context.menu=Indent|1100|</div>
         If command.name is empty then no item is added to the Tools menu. This can be used
         for commands that are only in the context menu or user shortcuts.

        export.pdf.magnification is a value that is added to the font size of the default screen style in use.
        A positive value increases the PDF document's font size, and vice versa.<br />
        export.pdf.font accepts a one-word parameter that selects one of the default PDF fonts: Courier,
        Helvetica or Times. Helvetica is the default. Helvetica and Times do not line wrap, Courier line
        wraps.<br />
        export.pdf.pagesize is used to set the document's page size, using points (1/72th of an inch) as
        the unit. E.g. Letter paper (8.5 inch x 11 inch) is specified using the values 612,792.<br />
        export.pdf.margins sets the widths of the page margins. Margins defaults to 72 points,
        or 1 inch.<br />
        The PDF exporter is necessarily feature-limited because PDF is a document archival format. Supporting
        a full set of features will bloat SciTE. Wrapping Helvetica or Times adequately isn't possible without
        the complexities of font metrics and kerning. The PDF produced uses WinAnsiEncoding, so pre-encoding
        has to be done before exporting to PDF, if you want to use extended characters.

        indentation and may be different from the tab size. Many people use a tab size of 8 but
        4 character indentation. When creating indentation, use.tabs determines whether the
        indentation is made up purely from space characters or from a mix of tabs and spaces
        using as many tabs as possible. <br />
        The global tabsize, indent.size, and use.tabs properties can be overridden for
        files that match a pattern by using the file pattern forms: <br />
        <div class="example">

        The properties file settings apply to newly opened files but remain constant once the file is open
        unless changed using the Change Indentation Settings dialog.<br />
        If tab.indents is set then pressing tab within indentation whitespace indents by indent.size
        rather than inserting a tab character. If backspace.unindents then pressing backspace
        within indentation whitespace unindents by indent.size rather than deleting the character
        before the caret.

          Each of these settings starts with a style number and then a set of words or characters
          that define how to recognise that feature. If there is a second space in the setting then
          it is a set of words, otherwise a set of characters. The set of keywords used to indicate
          the start of a compound statement is defined in statement.indent. For example:
        <div class="example">
                statement.indent.$(file.patterns.cpp)=5 if else while
         </div>
          says that for C++ the words "if", "else", and "while" in keyword style, 5, start compound
          statements which leads to the next line being indented if no other factors affect it. However,
          if a statement end is found on the same line then the next line is not indented. For C++ the
          statement end is the semicolon in the operator style, so this is defined:
         <div class="example">
                statement.end.$(file.patterns.cpp)=10 ;
         </div>
         The number of lines looked at to determine indentation can be set with statement.lookback.
         This can be used either to bound the amount of time spent on this task or to specify
         that only the last line be examined for indentation.<br />
         The block.start and block.end properties define the language elements used to bracket groups
         of statements. In C++ these are '{' and '}'.

        and sound duration. If sound is a number then it is treated as a pitch and
        played for the duration in milliseconds.
        Otherwise it is treated as a path to a sound file
        that is played. If you do not want a flash, specify 0 for flash duration.
        For example,
        <div class="example">
        warning.wrongfile=0,C:\Windows\Media\SFX\Glass.wav
        </div>
        will play the glass sound if open selected is given a bad file name.
        The findwrapped warning occurs when a find operation wraps past
        either end of the file,
        notfound when the find or preprocessor conditional move commands
        fail to find a match,
        executeok when a command such as build
        executes successfully, executeko when a command fails, and
        nootherbookmark when there is no bookmark to find.

                The menukey.* settings allow the user to redefine accelerator keys for menus
                without having to resort to modifying the SciTE source code.  The syntax for the setting is:
                <div class="example">
                menukey.menu_title.menu_name=&lt;modifier&gt;key
                </div>
                For example, the File | Exit command accelerator could be specified as follows:
                <div class="example">
                menukey.file.exit=&lt;control&gt;Q
                </div>
                Note that spaces in menu titles and names must be converted to underscores,

                Multiple modifiers may be specified, though each must be surrounded by angle brackets.  The
                recognised modifiers are the same as for the user.shortcuts setting described above.  The recognised named
                keys are also the same as for user.shortcuts, with the addition of "none" to indicate that no accelerator

          The ext.lua properties are specific to the <a href="SciTELua.html">
          SciTE Lua Scripting Extension</a>.  The extension.<i>filepattern</i> property
          is part of the generic <a href="SciTEExtension.html">SciTE Extension
          Interface</a> but is currently only used by the Lua Scripting Extension.
          <br />
          The ext.lua.startup.script property defines the filename of a Lua script that
          will be loaded when SciTE starts to set up the global state for Lua.
          The default value is $(SciteUserHome)/SciTEStartup.lua.
          You should use an absolute path for this property, but can reference the
          $(SciteDefaultHome) or $(SciteUserHome) properties.  Global event handlers,
          command functions, as well as other functions and objects can be defined here.
          <br />
          The ext.lua.auto.reload property determines what happens if you save the
          startup script, or the active extension script, from within SciTE.  If it
          is set to 0, the startup script only applied at startup time
          or when you switch buffers (depending on ext.lua.reset), and changes to the
          extension script are only applied when you switch buffers.  If
          ext.lua.auto.reload is set to 1 (the default), SciTE will re-initialize the global scope
          immediately when either script is saved from within SciTE.  <i>Even
          when ext.lua.auto.reload is enabled, SciTE will not notice if the files
          are changed from outside the current SciTE instance.  For that, see
          ext.lua.reset below.</i>
          <br />
          The ext.lua.reset property is primarily for debugging.  If ext.lua.reset
          is 0 (the default), the startup script property is checked only once -
          when SciTE starts.  If ext.lua.reset is changed to 1, SciTE will check
          the startup script property, and reload the new startup script, each
          time you switch buffers.  As such, it has a different (larger) set of
          side effects than ext.lua.auto.reload.  In some situations it will make
          sense for both auto.reload and reset to be enabled, but usually
          ext.lua.auto.reload alone will suffice.
          <br />
          Aside from ext.lua.startup.script, the extension.<i>filepattern</i> property
          provides a way to load additional functions and event handlers that may be
          specific to a given file type.  If the extension property value ends in .lua
          and names a file that exists, the Lua extension evaluates the script so that event
          handlers and commands defined in the script are available while that buffer
          is active.  Functions and objects defined through ext.lua.startup.script are
          still accessible, unless they are overridden.
          <br />
          The extension property can also define behaviour that is specific to a given
          directory.  If a bare filename (no path) is specified in the extension
          property, SciTE looks for the file in the standard property file locations,
          starting with the local directory.  This can be very useful in combination
          with a local SciTE.properties file.

          save.path.suggestion=$(SciteUserHome)\Notes\note_$(TimeStamp).txt<br/>

       Supporting a new language
    </h3>
    <p>
       For languages very similar to existing supported languages, which may only differ in a minor
      feature such as the keywords used, the existing lexers can often be reused. The set of
      keywords can then be changed to suit the new language. Java and JavaScript could have
      reasonably reused the C++ lexer. The Java lexer was added only to support doc comments.
    </p>
    <p>
       For languages that can not be lexed with the existing lexers, a new lexer can be coded in
       C++.&nbsp; These can either be built into Lexilla, or put into an
       external module and loaded when SciTE runs.
       See Lexilla and the <a href="#property-lexillapath">lexilla.path</a> property.
    </p>
    <p>
       The open.filter should be modified to include the file extensions used for the new language
      and entries added for command.compile, command.build, command.go and command.go.needs for the
      language.

       Creating API files
    </h3>
    <p>
       The .api files can be generated by hand or by using a program.
       There are also <a href="http://code.google.com/p/scite-files/wiki/Customization">downloadable ready-to-use
       .api files.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        For C/C++ headers, an API file can be generated using
        <a href="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">ctags</a>
        and then the <a href="tags2api.py">
        tags2api Python script</a> (which assumes C/C++ source) on the tags file to grab complete
        multiple line function prototypes.
        Some common headers surround parameter lists with a __P macro and may have
        comments. The <a href="cleanapi.cc">cleanapi</a> utility may be used on these files.
    </p>
    <p>
        To generate an API file for Python modules, there is a
        <a href="gen_python_api.zip">gen_python script</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        To generate an API file for Java classes, there is a
        <a href="ApiBuilder.java">ApiBuilder.java</a> program.
    </p>
    <h3 id="OpenSelected">
       Open Selected Filename
    </h3>
    <p>
       This command opens the file for the file name selected in either the edit or output pane.
       It uses the current selection or searches around the caret to try to
       find a file name based on which characters are normally used in a path.
       If there is no extension then an extension may be inferred from the current file using the
       open.suffix property which defaults to .properties in a .properties file.
       If the file name is followed by a number (in a format similar to ctags, grep output,
       or Visual Studio messages) then that line is displayed in the opened file.
       If the file name is an absolute path then it is opened directly otherwise it is looked for
       in the current directory and then in the directory specified by the openpath property.
       On Windows, web, ftp, mail and news URLs are handled by opening their
       associated application.

       SciTE in other languages
    </h3>
    <p>
       SciTE can be and has been <a href="http://code.google.com/p/scite-files/wiki/Translations">translated into other languages</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Building">
       Building SciTE
    </h3>
    <p>
       The procedure for building and installing SciTE is described in the README file in the scite
       directory.

       Extending SciTE
    </h3>
    <p>
       There are two formal extension interfaces for SciTE, the
       <a href="SciTEExtension.html">SciTE Extension Interface</a>
       is for extending SciTE with code compiled into the SciTE executable and the
       <a href="SciTEDirector.html">SciTE Director Interface</a> is for
       manipulating SciTE on Windows from another application.
